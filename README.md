# notey

Programmable notes for your workflows.

## Concept

- Pages based on markdown (Similar to .md files)
- Pages have a plugin section to enable custom workflows (Example: Build sorted list of Todos based on due date of tasks inside of the page)
  - Hot reloading should be available for plugins
- MVP: Single Page Application (Later: Desktop app e.g. with electron)
